I am Research Scientist at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) (上海人工智能实验室),
leading a Fundamental Large Model Safety & Decision Intelligence research group. 
<!-- I am also co-working with [Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) from Shanghai AI Lab closely. -->
Recently, I have completed my postdoctoral fellowship under the guidance of Professor [Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) , where my research focused on the security aspects of large-scale models. My work delved into the vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms associated with AI systems, particularly in the context of large language models and their applications.


Previously, I received my Ph.D. in [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2022, advised by [Prof. Fuchun Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=DbviELoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Huaping Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/thuliuhuaping/). 

My research interest includes Large Language Model Safety, Multi-modal Large Model, and Robotic Embodied Intelligence for Trustworthy AGI.
Some of my current research keywords can be found below:
* **Large Language Model**: LLM Post-training and Safety Alignment, LLM Attack and Defense.
* **Multimodal LLM**: Modality Fusion, Multimodal alignment, VQA.
* **Embodied Robotics**: Robotic Manipulation, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning.

For **academic cooperation**, Please feel free to email me at *yangchao[at] pjlab [dot] org [dot] cn*.
For other matters, please contact me at *yangchao9264 [at] 126 [dot] com* or *yangchaoemigmo [at] gmail [dot] com*. 

<!-- I was also fortunate to receive my undergraduate degree from Sichuan University -->
 <!-- I graduated from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University with a master’s degree and from Sichuan University with a bachelor’s degree. -->

<!-- I was fortunate enough to get the guidance of  -->
 <!-- and [Prof. Wenbing Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0yNkmO4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) when pursuing my doctoral degree. -->
<!-- I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) -->
